An up-to-date web application inspired by Professor Todd Feil's [CodeHelp](http://personal.denison.edu/~feil/codehelp/), which is "a program to aid in the decryption (and encryption) of messages using 'paper-and-pencil' methods."

Special thanks to Mr. David Nassar for suggesting this project when studying cryptology in his Discrete Mathematics 2021-2022 class.

A web version of Todd Feil's
[CodeHelp](http://personal.denison.edu/~feil/codehelp/), which is "a program to
aid in the decryption (and encryption) of messages using 'paper-and-pencil'
methods."

Thanks to David Nassar who suggested this project when I studied cryptology
under him at Winchester Thurston School in Pittsburgh, PA.
